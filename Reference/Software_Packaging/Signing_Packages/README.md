The Sailfish SDK can be used for signing RPM packages - we have a [separate page](/Develop/Apps/Packaging/Signing_Packages) describing the usage. 

The package signatures are currently not used in Sailfish OS, but you can still use them for manually [verifying the package contents](/Develop/Apps/Packaging/Signing_Packages#verifying-the-signature).
